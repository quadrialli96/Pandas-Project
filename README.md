# Pandas-Project
This Project consists of the world Layoffs data from 2020-2022 Exploratory Data Analysis using Python with Jupyter. 
Data was collected from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theakhilb/layoffs-data-2022?select=layoffs_data.csv), which was scraped from (https://layoffs.fyi/)

Some of the Questions i answered during this EDA includes :
- Industry that had the most layoffs
- Quarters of the year between 2020-2022 where layoffs was the highest and lowest
- Percentage of the US companies based layoffs according to the data
- City with the most layoffs in the United States and top 3 industries in the city that was mostly affected.
- My assumptions on why Series B Companies have the 2nd most Layoffs based on the data.
